# Spotify Capstone Project

This project simulates the data analyses I would undertake as a hypothetical Data Scientist for Spotify. Given data on a set of 52,000 songs, I seek to better understand what makes music popular, as well as the audio features that make up specific genres. Historically, this domain was dominated by musicians and music theorists--through these analyses, I take a technical approach towards understanding a creative field. 

# Motivations

The Spotify Capstone Project was finished as of May 2024 for the Principles of Data Science course at New York University.
